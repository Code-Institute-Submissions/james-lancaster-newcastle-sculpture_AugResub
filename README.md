# Newcastle sculpture

Cities and towns the world over are adorned with public sculpture. Much of the time it gets sadly little attention from passers-by. It’s worth stopping to take a look, though, because not only are there some wonderful artistic gems to enjoy, there’s lots to be learned about local history, and about an area’s people and communities. 

As far as I can tell, there are few websites devoted to an individual city or town’s sculpture (Lichfield’s The city of sculpture, http://www.thecityofsculpture.co.uk/ is a rare example), but I’ve often thought I’d like to be able quickly to find out about an individual city’s public art, and I think there’s enough in Newcastle-upon-Tyne for it to be worthwhile providing a guide for others. In the fullness of time such a guide could provide guided walks and could expand to Northumbria and other cities in the North East. For now, a Newcastle guide might be of interest to visitors and tourists, locals, culture vultures and local history geeks, and those looking for a walk on a Sunday afternoon.

NOTE: Some of the photos are mine – I can only apologise for the bad quality – I’d never meant them to be anything other than a reminder for me.

# UX

## User stories
1. As a first time visitor, I would like to
* easily understand the main purpose of the site and be reassured that I have found a site which may have what I am looking for
* be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content
* find meaningful content, for instance, relevant information about Newcastle-upon-Tyne and its public art, with images, locations, and background information 
* to find information that would enable me to physically visit the sculptures
* join a mailing list and become part of a sculpture-loving community, if the site and its contents interest me, I might wish to
* follow the social media links relevant art world and local interest news

2. As a returning visitor, having found something useful or interesting in the site, I would like to
* find up to date information
* plan further visits to sculpture
* contribute information I have found about sculptures

## Strategy (user needs and business objectives)
1. The website is created simply for the pleasure of sharing information and to reach out to and connect with people with similar interests, or who might have similar interests. There are no plans for the site to be commercial in any way, for instance, by attracting sponsorship or advertising from local businesses
* The site must provide valuable information, in particular
  * Accurate details of the sculptures – name, sculptor, date, etc
  * Accurate location details, including details to plot them on Google Maps
* The site should provide a way to keep people informed about sculpture – in the first instance, by a newsletter, so that it’s not just a directory or gazetteer, but has an authorial voice.

2. The user stories above don’t rely on any particular demographic, but the tone of the site might appeal more to people with an existing interest in the arts or history. Included among users might be:
* tourists and visitors to Newcastle who would like some guidance and advice
* people interested in the visual arts, whether visiting Newcastle or resident
* local people wanting to get to know the city better
* people looking for an interesting way to spend some time in or near the city centre 

These different groups don’t necessarily need different information or functionality from the site.

## Scope (functional specifications and context requirements)
1. As a start, the website needs to provide the basic information described above
* Details of the sculptures
* Locations of the sculptures
* Photos of the sculptures
* Newsletter sign up form

2. Aspects to save till later:
* A separate page for each sculpture
* A full listing of all sculptures
* Suggested itineraries
* A facility for users to contribute information

## Structure (interaction and information design)
1. The site has a simple structure, one layer deep. Users may arrive on the home page, from which they navigate via the navigation bar to the other pages. Any pages can be equally navigated to from any other page. As stated above, other pages might be created, but these would not be accessible from the top navigation. This is beyond the scope of this project.
2. Home
* Sculpture image (hero image)
* Introductory text
* Small sculpture image for variety and interest

3. Location
* Introductory text
* Google Maps showing locations of sculptures

4. Newsletter
* Sculpture image
* Introductory text
* Newsletter sign up form
* Information about the Newcastle Sculpture project

## Skeleton (interface, navigation, and information design)
1. Wireframe mock-ups were developed on [Figma]( https://www.figma.com/file/XXX)
* Note on original intentions and any changes 
* Any other design developments or learning points about design
* See wireframe at [Figma]( https://www.figma.com/file/ XXX)

2. Colour scheme and imagery
* The colour scheme is based on modern minimal art and culture design, to give serious feel to the sight (rather than a local information / local entertainment style site)
* Any other points – eg, if a logo is designed, or a change to the name

3. Photographs
* Some photographs are mine, but they were taken only to prompt my memory and not for this website. Other photos are acknowledged as appropriate on the site and in this README.

4. Fonts
* Two variable Google Fonts were chosen. Work Sans has a bold, industrial, urban feel for the main heading, while Dosis, used for the rest of the text, is clear, simple, and modern. Sans Serif is the fallback font in case the font isn't imported into the site correctly.

## Surface (visual design)
1. The header includes a simple logo, formed form the site’s initials NS. This serves also as a favicon. On larger screens there is a navigation bar, and on smaller screens a toggler icon leading to the navigation.

2. The page body on all pages is a pale grey-green, chosen for its contemporary feel and because it sets off the sculpture colours well.

3. On all screen sizes the footer contains social media icons. The deep green is essentially a darker version of the light green and closes the page without too much fuss.

4. The Home page is presented as relatively uncluttered. A well known sculpture takes up somewhat over half a desktop screen, with empty space either side, and the full width of a mobile screen. Underneath is some simple introductory text and another sculpture image, chosen to contrast in subject with the main hero image.

5. The Locations page is the filling of the website, so to speak, between the other two pages. Here is the map with the details of the sculptures on it. 

6. The Newsletter page is very simple, with a sign up form [and a contact form?]. Underneath is a more colourful photo.
